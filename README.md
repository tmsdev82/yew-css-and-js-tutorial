# Rust WASM Yew frontend example using CSS and JavaScript

This repository contains an example application of how to build a web frontend in Rust using the [Yew framework](https://yew.rs/). In particular the example shows how to use CSS with conditions and how to integrate with JavaScript. In this case we use the framework chart.js to draw a line chart.

The tutorial explaining the project can be found on my blog here: [CSS and JavaScript WASM Rust: Yew how to P2](https://tms-dev-blog.com/css-and-javascript-wasm-rust-yew-how-to-p2/)


## Setup

Rust and cargo should be installed. The tool "[Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)" is also required. 

Then the app can be ran by using the trunk command:

```
trunk serve
```
